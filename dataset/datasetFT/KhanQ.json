The tree really has nothing to do with physical characteristics such as fur or number of legs. Because evolution allows lineages to change physiologically and anatomically, many pairs of species on earth are quite different. When we look at two species whose members outwardly appear somewhat similar, this is a clue that they share a recent common ancestor. For example, dogs and horses are biologically separate lineages, however they are similar enough (four legs, fur) that it is highly likely that the two lineages split more recently, such as two first cousins who's most recent common ancestor was a grandparent. When we talk about a biological common ancestor, we really mean an ancestral species consisting of many individuals. A \"grandparent population\" that split and became two separate populations, which persisted into becoming modern day dogs and horses. On the other hand, dogs and mosquitoes are very different, which is a clue that their common ancestor diverged into the two lineages a very long time ago, like two distant cousins sharing a great great great great great great grandparent. This ancestral species probably outwardly looked nothing like either a dog or a mosquito. So the whole idea of the tree of life is to convey the idea that all living species, including dogs, horses, and mosquitoes are related, even though some are more closely related than others.",

Animals are a type of eukaryote. For horses and dogs, here are the levels of the phylogenetic tree they share in common going from the most general to the more specific. Both dogs and horses are: eukaryotes (there is a cell nucleus) metazoa (animals) bilateria (animals with bilateral symmetry) deuterostomia (animals whose embryos form the anus before forming the mouth) chordata (animals whose embryos develop a notochord) craniata (chordates that have a skull) vertebrata (they have a spine with vertebrae) gnathostomata (they have a hinged jaw) sarcopterygii (they have bones) tetrapoda (they have four limbs) amniota (their embryos are in an amniotic sac) synapsida (they have a hole in their skulls behind their eyes) therapsida (legs are inline with the body, instead of off to the side as we see with reptiles) mammalia (their females make milk for their young) eutheria (placental mammals) And this is where they break into separate branches. Dogs are carnivora, caniformia, canidae, Canus lupus familiaris Horses are perissodactylia, hippomorpha, equidae, Equus ferus caballus Thus, as far as living things go, horses and dogs are quite similar, since they are both placental mammals, but they are not related at all after that. So, the important thing to understand here is not just a particular trait that they share in common, but the ancestral history of that trait and thus how distantly related they are to other types of life that also have that trait?

Some very primitive form of sexual reproduction (probably just sharing DNA randomly between single cells) led to greater variation in one population vs another. On a population scale, sexual reproduction clearly offers a selective advantage. The new-found variation means that the population as a whole can thrive in a wider variety of conditions because individuals are less similar to each other and the population as a whole can therefore survive in a wider variety of conditions. For example, let's say there is a population of cells that normally can survive in only dry, hot conditions. Let's say that through random mutation (which is pretty rare), one member of that population develops an allele of a gene that allows it to survive in humid conditions, and another member develops an allele of a different gene that allows it to survive in cold conditions. If the population can only reproduce asexually (i.e. by budding off clones), you would never find an individual that could survive both humidity AND cold. So, if the desert where this population of cells lives cooled AND humidified (maybe there's an ice age), none of the individuals of that asexually reproducing population would survive. BUT, if they did reproduce sexually, there could be an individual with BOTH new alleles who could survive both cold AND humidity. So in this scenario, sexual reproduction is a selective advantage over asexual reproduction. However, the original version of sexual reproduction was probably very, very simple compared to how it works in humans - remember, our version of sexual reproduction has had a ton of time to evolve its complexities.",

But, once in a while, the mutation is beneficial. There are many kinds of mutations. This is gene duplication. In gene duplication the offspring gets an extra copy of a gene, perhaps even on a completely different chromosome. Sometimes this is catastrophic, but a lot of times it can enhance an existing trait or simply just provide a backup copy of an existing gene. Gene duplication is a very common mutation and there are many genes we have extra copies of. Now, if we have a spare copy of a gene, then some of the time that allows a major mutation to occur in one of the copies without causing a catastrophic problem. Now, in particular, if one of the copies undergoes what is called a frameshift mutation, then that gene will now code for a completely different protein. This might do very little, might be harmful, or might actually cause a new trait to appear rather suddenly. There are documented cases of this kind of mutation.",

Depending on what it is connected to, a voltage source provides (generates) whatever current is needed to keep the voltage on its terminals constant.

This pattern will give you the correct configuration for all but about 19 elements. The actual filling order is more complicated. For example, the 4s and 3d have nearly the same energy level and so, in a way that varies according to which element it is, either of the two subshells could be the first to fill and there is no certainty that one will be completely filled before the other actually starts filling. There are similar irregularities in the filling of 5s and 4d as well as some other pairs of subshells. So, rather than going through the far more difficult to understand rules that do correctly predict the electron configurations for all elements, it is easier just to learn the elements that this simplified method doesn't work correctly for. Here they are: In the following elements, there is 1 electron, not the predicted 2, in the outermost s subshell, the 'missing' electron is instead located in the outermost d subshell: Cu, Cr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Ag, Pt, Au In Pd (palladium) the outermost s subshell, predicted to have 2 electrons, is actually empty. Both of these electrons are instead in the outermost d subshell. Thus, the actual configuration of the Pd is [Kr] 4d\u00b9\u2070 (the 5s is empty). All the other exceptions are in the f block and just have to be learned on a case-by-case basis. However, it is unlikely you would be asked to know these in a general chemistry course. Here are the f-block exceptions: La, Ce, Gd, Ac, Th, Pa, U, Np, Cm, Lr Note: in one of his videos, Sal does the configuration of La, but he gets it wrong. He did not know that La is an exception to the rule. There is a simple chart that makes learning the filling order easy. Note: Nickel has two electron configurations that are commonly encountered over which there is a dispute amongst chemists as to which should be considered the ground state. I have assumed that the configuration that follows the rules is the ground state, since that is what is usually taught in general chemistry. However, this is not certain.",

In scandium and the other d block members of period 4, the 3d is lower in energy than the 4s. However, because the 3d orbitals are smaller and more closely packed than the 4s, the electron-electron repulsion that occurs in the 3d subshell is enough to make it possible for 1 or 2 electrons to have a lower energy by occupying the 4s. So, we have 3d and 4s co-filling rather than filling independently. So, with scandium, the first electron after completing the previous noble gas configuration goes into 3d. The difference in energy levels between 4s and 3d is small enough for the next two electrons to enter the 4s, because the electron-electron repulsion they feel if they enter 3d is enough to knock them into the 4s. The same process happens throughout the d-block. Sometimes the difference in energy levels between the s and d allows one electron to enter the s, sometimes it the difference allows 2 electrons to enter the s. And in palladium alone, the difference between d and s is so great that none of the electron are in the s. For the first few members to of Groups 1 and 2 there is no d to be filled. But with 4s-3d, 5s-4d, etc. there is the d to take into consideration. The explanation is simple: in Groups 1 and 2, but not in the d block, the s is lower in energy than the d. In the d block it is the other way around. Because the difference in energy levels between 4s-3d, 5s-4d, etc. varies by element, we have to look at each element on a case-by-case basis to see how these will fill. Similar irregularities appear in the f block, only now there are s, d and f subshells all with similar energy levels.",

        "Context": "There are four elements whose positions in the f or d block is disputed by chemists. Thus, where they 'belong' depends on whom you ask. Those four elements are La, Ac, Lr and Lu. Some chemists place La and Ac in the d-block, some in the f-block. Some place Lr and Lu in the d-block, some in the f-block. The official periodic table maintained by IUPAC has all four of the disputed elements in the f-block, but this is by no means a settled matter. So, the answer just has to be that it depends on whom you ask whether these four elements are in the d or f block. There are approximately 19 elements whose configurations do not match the trend. Teachers give all manner of creative explanations as to why there are exceptions (such as saying that fully filled or half-filled d-subshells are extra-stable). But, the truth is both more simple and more frustrating (because it is hard to predict). We say that 4s fills before 3d, that 5s fills before 4d. Then we say that we that in period 6 the order is 6s, 4f, 5d. But this is not exactly true. It would be better to say that these sets co-fill and that which one gets filled first depends on the nuances of the element. That happens because these sets of subshells have nearly the same energy level and thus the electron-electron repulsion within a subshell can determine where the next electron to fill will go. Furthermore, exactly which subshell is lower in energy (remember they are very close to each other) can vary by the element. So, which subshell is inherently lower in energy and likely to the electrons first varies by element (not much, this is a small effect). If the electron-electron repulsion within that subshell is greater than the energy difference between the next higher subshell, then the electron will go into the next higher subshell. So, you have to take both of these phenomena together to determine exactly how these subshells will fill. In the case of La, we get [Xe] 5d\u00b9 6s2 because the 6s energy is very slightly less than the 5d and 4f, so it gets it get two electrons. The remaining electron goes into 5d because in lanthanum the 5d is lower in energy than 4f (though they are almost identical in energy). The differences in energy levels between 6s, 5d and 4f vary as we go across the f block, as does the nuances of electron-electron repulsion within the same subshell.

When oxygen and hydrogen mix together to make water, they release a tremendous amount of energy, and you wind up with two atoms of hydrogen being held (we call that 'bonded') to one atom of oxygen. You have the same atoms, but the amount of energy they have now is much, much less and their electrical fields have radically changed. Thus, water is not much like hydrogen or oxygen, but has its own properties. A better analogy than mixing paint is mixing wheat, water, and oil (and a few minor ingredients). Think of all the things you can make with just these three things depending on how much of each you use and how you put them together. You can get dough, biscuits, noodles, pudding, breakfast cereal, glue, gravy, sauces, a variety of wheat beers, farina, etc. It all depends on how much of the components you use and just how you go about putting them together. Much the same thing happens at the microscopic level -- what you get depends on how much you have of a few basic 'ingredients' and how you go about putting them together.",

However, the final goal of the Alchemist was not the making of money. It's even been done in nuclear reactors. Sadly, there are two problems: 1) You normally get a radioactive form of gold (a radio-isotope), so it doesn't stay gold for very long. 2) The cost to make the gold (cost for the electricity you need to power a particle accelerator or whatever) is bigger than the price of gold. Transmutation of atoms or changing of one atom to another is possible but involves high costs. You will have to shell out a lot of bucks to transmutate 1 gram of lead to 1 gram of gold but the money you earn from selling the gold, will be insignificant compared the cost of converting lead to gold. We can change atoms into gold or any other element,however the expense of adding or removing nucleons ( protons & neutrons ) would in itself be so much ,so I don't think you could get rich by doing it, plus ,the technology is way too expensive.But maybe it'll be easier in the future. Technically speaking, it could be possible through atomic fusion, but stars, the original source of fusion, only has enough energy to create iron through this process. While a solar fusion engine has been created, it would need several times the power it can give to fuse elements heavier than iron. Also, the energy to run said engine would cost so much that it would be cheaper to try to extract minerals from asteroids in space.",

The atom bomb really deals with the nucleus and not the whole atom. Hydrogen bombs are when a fission bomb is used to initiate a fusion bomb of smaller nuclei such as hydrogen. The order of magnitude for a thermonuclear bond (H-bomb) is on the order of 10,000,000 tons of TNT,while the atom bomb is more about 20,000 tons of TNT as per the first testing of each of these types of bombs. when spliting an atom, a HUGE amount of energy comes out and this is what makes the atom bomb so powerful and fearful!! the trigger sets a fission course on the earth and energy then becomes destructive. It splits the atom, thus exploding, kind of like how we use nuclear fission to harness the energy creating nuclear power.

It will, if conditions allow, eventually drop back to n=1. So, it is not a matter of the electron not returning to n=1, it is just that it might do so in a number of steps instead of all at once. An electron in the n=1 state is stable because it cannot go any lower, being already at the lowest allowed energy state state, and can only go higher if energy is applied. So, it cannot cannot spontaneously move. That is the sense in which it is stable. In general, an electron at any energy level cannot spontaneously jump up since that would require an outside source of energy. But it can at any time spontaneously jump down to any lower energy level by ejecting a photon. Any level below it is just as likely as any other for it to jump to. But it is a one-way ratchet.

For example, the tungsten filaments in incandescent light bulbs give off all colours of the visible spectrum (although most of the electrical energy ends up emitted as infrared (IR) photons, explaining why tungsten filament light bulbs are only 5-10% energy efficient). The explanation comes from the band theory of the solid state: in metallic solids, the electronic energy levels of all the valence electrons form bands of zillions of energy levels packed really closely together, with the electrons essentially free to move from one to any other. All the possible transitions involve all possible frequencies, so the spectrum emitted is continuous. The band theory also explains electronic properties of semiconductors used in all popular electronics nowadays, so it is not BS. Continuous spectra do not exist and it is really a line, i.e. absorption occurs at a very specific frequency. I can explain this further: when an element absorbs light, what happens is that the electron gains this energy from the light and jumps energy levels and is now in an excited state. The reason why it is at a very specific frequency is because the electrons are in a specific electron shell, and even have a different force toward the nucleus (based on the number of protons). Therefore, 1. each atom/element has it's own unique absorption spectrum, 2. because each outer most electron all elements requires a different amount of energy to get to this excited state.",

To view the spectrum we need hydrogen in its gaseous form, so that the individual atoms are floating around, not interacting too much with one another. The sun is not just a big ball of H atoms loosely floating around. For one thing, the temperature is very high, so the atoms are ionized. In other words, you have a lot of H nuclei (ie protons) and a lot of electrons, and they aren't bound together to make a nice simple H atom. Also, you have enormous pressure, which forces all of the atoms to interact with one another in a way that they don't when they are in low-pressure gas form. The interactions between the particles create a different, much larger set of energy levels that permit a continuous rather than discrete spectrum. The sun radiates like a so-called 'black body' with temperature around 5700K. When astronomers study distant stars they actually look at ABSORPTION spectra rather than emission spectra. The absorption spectrum is what's left after the white light passes through the outer layers of the star, where the pressure is lower and the protons can join with the electrons to make complete H atoms. The absorption spectrum is like the negative of the emission spectrum, it has dark lines where the emission spectrum has light.

Sal is not providing those details here, but is speaking more qualitatively. Still, the entropy increase with either volume increase or temperature increase can be understood at this qualitative level. The micro-state of a gas is given by the location and velocity of each molecule in the gas. If the volume increases, the molecules have more locations they can be at, hence more micro-states. If the temperature increases, the molecules have more velocities with which they can move, hence more micro-states.

It would be energy and time-consuming and hard to switch from one to another. This way is cost-effective and time-efficient for our bodies. I will illustrate it with the example of fighting cancer. Although originally designed to inhibit a single kinase, several small molecule inhibitors target several, often related, kinases. When used to treat tumours bearing activating mutations in a single kinase, these 'promiscuous' inhibitors have shown clinical effectiveness and less toxicity than expected. This effect may stem from their capacity to inhibit several kinases in a signalling 'network'. However, another possibility is that these broad-spectrum inhibitors inhibit kinases that might be activated by subsequent mutations. Now the problem of 'complex signalling pathway' bothers researchers when choosing methodology on how to study pathways and molecules. how to use genetic manipulations to overcome these difficulties. Phenotypes generated using traditional 'knockout' techniques-which completely ablate expression of a signalling protein-represent the aggregate consequence of disrupting all functions of, and severing all communication facilitated by, that protein. In contrast, more refined 'knock-in' techniques-which insert a discrete mutation into only one region of a protein-allow controlled manipulation of specific protein functions and signal interconnections. having complex system is good because that way one signalling molecule (let's take cAMP) can shut down or turn on multiple other enzymes and cascades. That way body only makes an effort to produce the first initial second messenger. The job is done. cANP binds to many different kinases and initiates 7 different processes!

If you have a steam engine you have to use fuel to add heat to the water to get it to a temperature where is converts to steam. This steam expands into the cooler environment. In this case you are taking the low entropy energy in the chemical bonds of the fuel and creating high entropy heat energy that transferred to the water increasing its entropy when it gets hotter and eventually converts into steam creating the pressure to do work like creating electricity. If the entire environment was as the same temperature of the burning fuel the water would already be steam and it couldn't be made to do anything.",

Hydrogen itself exists as a liquid in only the most extreme conditions, so it is extremely rare. Solid hydrogen is even more rare. Pure hydrogen mostly exists as a plasma in stars or elsewhere as a gas.",

About NaCl, there is a huge difference in electronegativity between the two atoms and it makes sense that this bond is ionic.

The electrons which are transferred or localized are called 'Valence Electrons' which means the electrons residing on the last orbit in an atom. The valence electrons are loosely bound in all the atoms may it be of a conductor or of an insulator. 'Loosely Bound' means that if we can apply enough force which supersedes the attraction force between the nucleus and the electrons, the electrons will be transferred to a positively charged atom (for conductors) or be localized at a side of an atom (for insulators). If we take a positively charged atom to a neutral one, the electrostatic force occurring between the positive charge and the valence electrons of the atom (because of Coulomb's Law) is more than the force between the valence electrons and the protons of its own atom. So, the electrons will be transferred to the positively charged atom as those will have enough energy to get 'free'. That is why they are called 'Free Electrons'. For insulators and semiconductors, almost the same incident happens; but the electrons can't be transferred, instead, they get localized at a side of the atom. The reason is that to get free, the electrons have to be in 'Conduction Band'(kind of an energy state), but here they are in 'Valence Band' which is a lower energy state. Though they don't have enough energy to get free, they localize at a side of the atom. If you want to know more about 'Electron Bands', you can google a bit and I hope you'll find some YouTube videos which might clear some of your clouds in mind.

Genes, in fact, tend to be involved in multiple phenotypic traits because the protein they code for can be used in a variety of ways. Alleles are variations of genes, but they may or may not produce observable differences in some phenotypic trait. The reason is that proteins tend to be very large molecules and so a few minor changes here or there in their structure may or may not have much of an effect on their functions.

When humans look at a fleas, humans look at them and find them too very primitive. It can't use tools like humans can, it can't build houses for shelter like humans do, it can't build a fire to keep itself warm, it can't even talk with other fleas. So, humans see all of those traits that humans can do that are essential for humans survival that the flea can't do and humans see ourselves as superior to a flea. However, if that flea had the same mental capacity as humans do and can make the same judgment, it would look at humans to say look at those apes, humans can jump 100 times my own height they can barely jump 1/3 of their height. If they fall from a height of 3 times their own height they run the risk of breaking a bone and even dying. Me, my hard exoskeleton protects me from any fall even if its 1000s of times my own height. humans can jump from the ground on to a deer without it even noticing, then hide in its fur, feed off of it and even start a family all awhile being protected within the deer's fur, let us see a human do that So which one is better. What would happen if humans evolved the ability to jump 100s of times their own height so its on par with a fleas ability? Well, obviously, humans would be able to jump 500-600 feet in the air, and since humans skeletal structure is the way it is, we would immediately die on impact. So the fleas have it much better than humans in that regards. Conversely, What would happen if a flea evolved to have the reasoning and mental capacity equal to a human? Well, what is a flea even going to use that for? Humans originally used it to develop primitive weaponry for hunting as well as to domesticate fire for warmth and cooking humans kills. Would any of that, in any way, be of any help to a fleas survival? No; of course not. Those skills would be completely useless to a flea. They need to jump onto passing mammals, drink their blood and hide in their fur. Not kill cook and eat like humans. A human is no more evolved than any other primate or even a common flea. Every species evolved in a way that gives it the best possible chance to survive long enough to pass on its genes to the next generation.",

But after isotopes were discovered (oxygen-17, oxygen-18, etc), everything got really confusing, so scientists agreed to use carbon-12. The average atomic mass for hydrogen is actually around 1.008 amu. Protium is by far the must abundant isotope of hydrogen, and it only contains 1 proton, and no neutrons. The relative abundance of Deutrium (1 proton, 1 neutron) is so small that it is barely accounted for when calculating the average atomic mass. So the mass of a proton is around 1.008 amu, not 1. Following this logic, the carbon-12 atom's atomic mass should actually be 12.09 amu; however, the mass is exactly 12 amu. Why? The missing mass is called mass defect, and it represents the binding energy. Since the nucleus is full of protons, which has positive charge, they would repel and the nucleus would fly apart. Binding energy is the energy that holds the nucleus together. Because of energy-mass equivalence (E = mc^2), we know that energy and mass are interchangeable. Some of the mass of the atom gets converted into binding energy, so the mass of the entire nucleus would actually be less than the mass of each individual proton and neutron added together. This is why the mass of carbon-12 is 12 amu, not 12.09. Scientists used carbon-12 because no other atom has exact whole-number masses in the amu scale.

It is quite likely, and in redox reactions a certainty, that some of the atoms will have have a change in their oxidation states as a consequence of the reaction. The oxidation state is an assigned value based upon am agreed-upon set of rules. You should be taught the basics of these rules in class (there are many details in the rules that we don't typically cover at the introductory level because some of these are for special situations). The oxidation state is a method of summarizing a large number of chemical properties. Here are some of the main rules, listed in order of importance from greatest to least. If there is a contradiction in the rules, the rule listed first should be followed: 1. The oxidation of an element in its elemental form (that is, a neutral element that is bonded to nothing except other atoms of itself) is 0. Thus, H2. F2, Ne, S\u2088 all have the state 0. There are no exceptions to this rule. 2. The oxidation state of a monatomic ion is the charge on that ion. There are no exceptions to this rule. 3. Hydrogen has a state of +1 except in the hydrides of active metals in which case it has -1. 4. Fluorine has a state of \u22121. 5. Oxygen has a state of \u22122, except in peroxides in which case it has \u22121 or when directly bonded to fluorine in which case it may have a positive oxidation state. (There are some other exceptions, but these are obscure). 6. Group 1 elements have a state of +1, except for hydrogen as mentioned above. 7. Group 2 elements usually have a state of +2 8. Group 17 (the halogens) usually have a state of \u22121 unless directly bonded to other halogens, in which case the lowest atomic number halogen has a state of \u22121. For example, in BrCl, Bromine has the +1 state and Cl has the \u22121 state. Also, halogens other than F may have different states when bonded directly to oxygen. 9. The sum of oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral compound must be zero. For ions, the sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in the ion must equal the charge of that ion. 10. Ag nearly always has the +1 state. Cd and Zn nearly always have a state of +2. Al nearly always has a state of +3. *NOTE: not an actual rule, but the oxidation state is nearly always an integer*. Atoms not explicitly mentioned in the above rules have their oxidation states determined by enforcing those rules. For example, in WCl\u2085, following the rules we assign \u22121 to each of the 5 Cl atoms. Thus, in order for the sum of the oxidation states to equal 0 (since this is a neutral compound) the state of W must be +5. However, in WCl\u2086, there are six atoms of Cl to assign the \u22121 charge to, thus W must have a state of +6. Here is a very difficult example: NaC\u2085H\u2085 (called Sodium cyclopentadienide). Following the rules: Na gets +1 and each of the five H gets +1 There are six +1, so in order to sum to zero, the sum of the oxidation states of the five C atoms must sum to \u22126. Thus, carbon has a \u2212\u2076\u2044\u2085 oxidation state. (Again, unusual because oxidation states are nearly always integers.)",

        "Context": "First let's consider the attraction applied on positive & negative atoms/particles. We know that opposite charges attract, and like charges repel. Let's review a few terms. *Electron Affinity* is the measure of how easily an atom will take another atom. *Electronegativity* is the measure of how much an atom wants to hog an electron in a covalent bond. If we add an electron to an atom, if will experience opposite charges from the other electrons, but it will also experience a bigger like charge from the protons in the nucleus, which will pull the electron in with a net charge. Because of this, we say that the cost of Electron Affinity (adding an electron to an atom) is negative, because we gain energy. If we imagine that we put an electron close to the atom, the atom would pull that electron in, converting potential energy into kinetic energy, until it comes to a stable position near the nucleus. But now lets think about taking away that electron. If we try to take away that electron, then it will *cost* energy from us in some manner. Like _another atom_ would have enough electrostatic energy to pull away that electron from the atom. If something will cost us energy to perform, we say it has negative potential energy. I have given examples of electrons being attracted to atoms, but really anything with a net positive charge or net negative charge will be attracted, such as a cation (positive ion/atom) and a anion (negative ion/atom). If the two atoms are a _certain distance_ away from each other, then the force applied on each other is so weak that it is approaching 0. Which makes since, if we have two magnets, if we hold them close we feel a pull, but if we hold them farther away, they started to lose that pulls. As it gets easier & easier to pull the atom away from the oppositely charged atom, that means that the potential energy is increasing from being negative. When it was negative, we had to apply a force to take it away, but as it approaches 0, we no longer feel a force applied on each, and we can easily move the atom around. The *bond energy* is the amount of energy required to separate two bonded atoms. If you try to push two atoms together, then their positively charged protons in the nuclei will provide quite a bit of resistance to that. Though each of the atoms have a net different charge, their nuclei are still positive so their nuclei would resist that movement. Why do bigger bonds have bigger bond energies? If we take hydrogen, only 1 pair of electrons is shared so it has a single bond. Oxygen has 2 pairs of electrons shared, so it has a double bond. Why does oxygen have a higher bond energy? If we look at a covalent bond, the atoms are bonded *only* by the electrons they share. If they don't share the electrons they would float apart. That is in contrast to an ionic bond, where two atoms are attracted by their opposite charges. So the more electrons two atoms will share in a covalent bond, the more they are bonded together.",

Eventually (after less than a few seconds) it became cold enough to condense into normal matter, in a process we have called _baryogenesis_. The problem is that our current best theories of particle physics predict that all processes that create matter must also create an equal amount of anti-matter, which would then annihilate each other leaving only light. Since we see a lot of matter all around us, this clearly is not the case. For some unknown reason, there was a lot more matter than anti-matter created in the beginning, when the universe was cooling down.

All objects bend spacetime, and more massive/dense objects bend it more steeply. That is they have a stronger gravitational pull. Since mass == energy (E=MC2)energy will indeed bend space time, if there is enough energy in a small enough space. However, consider the following. It requires the mass of an entire moon or planet to have an effect strong enough for you to feel. Since E=MC2 the amount of energy required to bend space the same amount (that is to have a gravitational influence that humans could detect without instruments) is unfathomable. If there's energy that dense it tends to collapse into matter. Indeed, this is what happens in our particle accelerators such as the LHC. As for black holes, they are locations in space where there is mass dense enough to bend spacetime so steeply that it would require movement faster than the speed of light to escape. Due to the nature of our Universe it is impossible to exceed the speed of light (I'm aware that sounds vague, but it would take a good hour to explain in more detail).

It is a thing that happens to sometimes behave in ways that seem particle-like to us, and sometimes behave in ways that seem wave-like to us, but that does not mean it is one or the other or both of those things. Newton thought light was a particle, but then for a long time the prevailing view was that it was a wave, a perspective that was reinforced by Maxwell's discovery of the equations that govern electromagnetism. Embedded in his equations was the notion that electromagnetic waves travel at a speed of 3*10^8 m/s. It was known that this was also the speed of light, so physicists concluded that light is an electromagnetic wave. This wave view, though, started to get in trouble in the late 1800's as physicists struggled and failed to find the medium that this wave was traveling through. It was not until the early 1900's that physicists, largely thanks to Einstein, finally realized that we have to accept light on its own terms rather than force it into a category that is more familiar to us.",

A good demonstration of this is Thomas Young's double slit experiment. Basically he placed a plate in front of screen with two slits (or holes) in the plate which allowed light to pass through and would be detected on the screen behind. The critical aspect was how wide he made the slits. If you make the slits wide light passes straight through and hits the areas of the screen directly opposite of the slits. This is light behaving as a particle. Now if you made the slits super narrow you observe bands of light with different intensity on the screen separated by dark spaces. The bands corresponding to places where light acting as a wave interacted with itself constructively and the dark spaces where it interacted with itself destructively. This is known as interference and its something only waves can perform.

Waves that we are familiar with need a medium. Light does not. Particles that we are familiar with do not diffract and refract and get polarized. Light does. For hundreds of years the the seeming dual nature of light puzzled physicists, and now finally we have learned that we just have to accept it on its own terms.",

For example the 'hole' between the O atoms in 18-crown-6 is just the right size and shape for potassium ions to fit in and have their unfilled orbitals form Lewis complexes with the O atoms. The size and shape of the cavity between the O (and N) atoms determines which cations will be selectively complexed. For example,the holes in diaza-18-crown-6 and diaza-21-crown-7 are the right size to selectively complex with calcium and magnesium ions. To dissolve smaller ions such as Na+ and Li+ ,we use correspondingly smaller crown ethers such as 15-Crown-5 for Na+ and 12-Crown-4 for Li+. Since crown ethers are ethers, they are soluble in organic solvents. They are especially useful for dissolving salts in organic solvents. For example, KMnO4 normally does not dissolve appreciably in organic solvents, but it will dissolve fairly well in the presence of 18-crown-6. The 18-crown-6 chelates the potassium ion and pulls it into the organic layer, and where the cation goes the anion must follow. Crown ethers are used to bring inorganic catalysts into the organic phase and to increase the solubility of inorganic compounds in organic solvents to promote chemical reactions. So changing the numbers of C and O atoms does indeed affect the properties of crown ethers.",

Reactivity and stability are two opposing concepts. The more stable a molecule is, the less it wants to react. A decrease in stability results in an increase in reactivity and an increase in stability causes a decrease in reactivity. Think of it this way: a molecule always wants to be in it's most stable form. If it's not stable, it is going to want to react in order to stabilize itself.

The swap involves a single adjacent methyl group swapping with the + charge. Turning a butyl chloride into a tert-butyl would satisfy rule one, but it goes against rule two.

So when the somatic cell goes in to the mitosis stage, the X and Y sister chromatids would be separated, resulting in each one X and Y chromosome again in each daughter cell. That's why your cells in your body all have XY chromosomes. In meiosis, crossing over also happens at sex chromosomes but the region where the crossing over would happen is limited and it is called pseudoautosomal region. But overall the crossing over would not harm the function of sex chromosomes. One thing meiosis is different from mitosis is that if you are a male, your four haploid daughter cells would have two each contain one X chromosome and the other two each contain one Y chromosome, meaning none of your gamete has a complete pair of sex determine chromosome like XX or XY.",

Meiosis: Germ cells with the diploid number (in your example, 24) of chromosomes will go through meiosis I and meiosis II. In the first phase, each chromosome will be replicated (so each has two sister chromatids) and paired with its homologous chromosome (the paternal and maternal chromosomes, for example, which code for the same genes). Then after meiosis I has finished, each new daughter cell will have the haploid (12) number. But they go through Meiosis II, which separates the sister chromatids and creates two haploid gametes. An elaboration might help: For meiosis, one diploid germ cell will replicate its chromosomes. These chromosomes pair with their homologous chromosomes. Meiosis I will split these apart, becoming two haploid cells, call them A and B, but each chromosome is two sister chromatids, so it still has 2n strands of DNA despite only having n chromosomes (I believe this is the more confusing part of the process for some). Our haploids A and B will both go through their own meiosis (phase II), which is a lot more like mitosis than the first stage is, as this results in four gamete haploid cells, two of them are daughter cells of A, and the other two are daughter cells of B. So in your example, a 2n=24 diploid cell undergoing meiosis would follow this path <#chromosomes, # DNA strands> <24, 48> -> Meiosis I -> [A = <12, 24> | B = <12, 24>] -> Meiosis II-> [A1 = <12, 12> | A2 = <12, 12> | B1 = <12, 12> | B2 = <12, 12>] Thus, we end with 4 gametes ready for fertilization. Gametes can not themselves divide, so the four cells at the end are it. There are many diagrams available if you need further assistance. EDIT: DNA is double-stranded, which I neglected to account for. When reading the #DNA strands above, I am referring to the number of double-helices.

Boron usually does not follow the octet rule, though it sometimes does. Other elements, such as S and P, sometimes do not follow the octet rule.

The octet rule follows from the energetic favorability of having both the s and p subshells either completely empty or completely full. There is no p subshell in shell number 1, so that is part of why the lightest elements do not follow the octet rule (there are other reasons). There are many considerations as to what does or does not make an atom with a particular electron configuration reactive or nonreactive. So, while the octet rule is a convenient rule of thumb, the reality of chemistry is much, much more complicated. So, with chemistry, there are many competing factors that affect how elements behave, so you cannot just take a single rule and insist or suspect that every element must necessarily follow that rule. It doesn't work that way. You have to take all of the factors into consideration to predict how an element might behave. NOTE: The Pauli exclusion principle is one of the few laws that all of the elements always obey. But the octet rule is not always followed.",

These reactions are how a buffer keeps the pH from changing too much when acids or bases are added. The reason why a weak acid alone is usually not a very good buffer is that by definition, weak acids don't dissociate very much in solution. So that means a weak acid solution (let's call it HA) contains mostly undissociated weak acid HA, and not much of the conjugate base, A-. So it won't be very good at soaking up added acid, and it won't make a good buffer. We can fix that by increasing the amount of A- in the solution, either by adding an external source of A- (usually by adding some salt that contains A-, perhaps NaA), or by adding some strong base like NaOH. The strong base reacts with HA to make water and A-, the conjugate base!

Oxygen has an oxidation number of -2, and usually goes up to 0, making it oxidized (an element always has an oxidation number of 0, therefore O2 has an oxidation number of 0, thus increasing its oxidation number since 0 > -2 --> oxygen is oxidized). And by the way, Oxygen doesn't gain electrons, it loses them. Oxygen is a nonmetal with a charge of -2 in its ionic state. So in order to satisfy the octet rule, it loses its two valence electrons in the valence shell!",

The DNA in chromatin is wound around protein complexes called nucleosomes and then further twisted and looped into higher order structures. There are a large number of proteins involved in this packaging (and also in the unpackaging that has to happen for replication and transcription to occur).
