    "main_output": "Imagine playing cricket on the Moon. If you hit the ball, you won’t hear the sound of the bat because there is no air to carry the sound. Also, there is no wind to blow dust like we see on a village road. That’s why astronauts need special suits with oxygen when they visit the Moon. Without air, there’s also no weather—no rain, no storms, just silence and stillness.",

    "main_output": "Mangroves are like goalkeepers for the land. Just like a goalkeeper stops a football from entering the goal, mangrove trees stop large waves from hitting the land too hard. Their strong roots hold the soil tightly, so it doesn’t wash away in floods. They also provide a home for fish and birds. Without mangroves, coastal villages would be in danger during storms.",

    "main_output": "Think of a video game controller. If you press the right buttons, the game responds. A switch works the same way—it connects or disconnects a path for electricity to flow. When you turn the switch on, it’s like pressing the 'Start' button in a game, letting power reach the fan or light. When you turn it off, it's like pressing 'Pause'—the power stops moving.",

    "main_output": "Imagine you are running in a game of kho-kho on a hot day, and you see sweat on your arms. When warm air rises in the sky, it also carries tiny water drops. When this air cools down high up, these drops come together to make a cloud, just like your sweat turns into tiny misty droplets in the morning. If the drops in a cloud grow big, they fall as rain!",
