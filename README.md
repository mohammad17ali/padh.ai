PADHAI is a platform designed to democratize education. Learners get tailored learning resources and are encouraged to explore fields they're interested in.

## Project Vision
I aim to create an AI mentor that **adapts to students' comprehension levels** in real-time, focusing on sparking curiosity rather than delivering static lectures. The system will prioritize **personalized knowledge scaffolding** through conversational interactions, using students' responses to dynamically adjust content depth.

## Core Objectives
1. **Understanding Assessment**
   - Implement implicit knowledge evaluation through open-ended questions
   - Track conceptual grasp using conversation history analysis
   - Categorize users into 3 tiers: Foundational/Intermediate/Advanced

2. **Adaptive Content Delivery**
   - **Novice Mode**: Focus on relatable analogies + "Did you know?" facts
   - **Intermediate Mode**: Introduce controlled complexity with Socratic questioning
   - **Advanced Mode**: Enable exploratory discussions with research paper references

3. **Anti-Spoonfeeding Mechanism**
   - Never provide direct answers to homework/test questions
   - Deploy counter-questions like "What if we approach this from [alternative perspective]?"
   - Suggest 3 curated resources per concept (videos, podcasts, interactive tools)
